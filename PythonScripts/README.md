# Python Scripts

This directory contains Python scripts for various uses.

One of them is a tool to compare progress of localization to different languages, see the module
`audit_translations`.

Project management is done with [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).

For example, execute `uv run python -m audit_translations de` to see the translation progress for the German language.
