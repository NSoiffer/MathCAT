## Information for AT and Other Library Users

When calling from python, the general ordering is:
1. The location of the MathCAT `Rules` directory is set [SetRulesDir]
1. Whatever preferences the AT needs to set, it is done with calls to [`SetPreference`]. Typically the `Language` and TTS engine to use (if any -- strongly recommended) are given. 
2. The MathML is sent over via [`SetMathML`].
3. AT calls to get the speech [`GetSpokenText`] and calls [`GetBraille`] to get the (Unicode) braille. If the id of a node is given, then the corresponding braille cells will be highlighted.

Navigation can be done via calls to either:
* [`DoNavigateKeyPress`] (takes key events as input)
* [`DoNavigateCommand`] (takes the commands the key events internally map to)

Both return a string to speak.
To highlight the current navigation node, 'id's are used. If they weren't already present,
[`SetMathML`] returns a string representing MathML that contains 'id's for any node that doesn't already
have an 'id' set. You can get the current node with
* [`GetNavigationMathMLId`]
* [`GetNavigationMathML`] -- returns a string representing the MathML for the selected node

Note: a second integer is returned by both of these calls. This number is the offset in characters for a leaf node.
This is needed when navigating by character for multi-symbol leaf nodes such as "sin" and "1234".
Currently the value is always '0' -- this feature needs more implementation work.

It is also possible to find out what preferences are currently set by calling [`GetPreference`]

All functions return a potential error code.

## Rust Users
MathCAT is written in Rust, so all you need to do is build MathCAT and in your project's Cargo.toml file add something like
```
[dependencies.mathcat]
version = "0.1.22"
```

The exact function signatures are (with comments):
```
/// Set the Rules directory
/// IMPORTANT: this should be the very first call to MathCAT unless the environment var MathCATRulesDir is set
pub fn set_rules_dir(dir: String) -> Result<()>

/// Returns the version number (from Cargo.toml) of the build
pub fn get_version() -> String

/// This will override any previous MathML that was set.
/// This returns canonical MathML with 'id's set on any node that doesn't have an id.
/// The ids can be used for sync highlighting if the `Bookmark` API preference is true.
pub fn set_mathml(mathml_str: String) -> Result<String>

/// Get the spoken text of the MathML that was set.
/// The speech takes into account any AT or user preferences.
pub fn get_spoken_text() -> Result<String>

/// Get the spoken text for an overview of the MathML that was set.
/// The speech takes into account any AT or user preferences.
/// Note: this implementation for is currently minimal and should not be used.
pub fn get_overview_text() -> Result<String>

/// Get the value of the named preference.
/// None is returned if `name` is not a known preference.
pub fn get_preference(name: String) -> Result<String>

/// Set a MathCAT preference. The preference name should be a known preference name.
/// The value should either be a string or a number (depending upon the preference being set)
/// The list of known user preferences is in the MathCAT user documentation.
/// Here are common preferences set by programs (not settable by the user):
/// * TTS -- SSML, SAPI5, None
/// * Pitch -- normalized at '1.0'
/// * Rate -- words per minute (should match current speech rate).
///       There is a separate "MathRate" that is user settable that causes a relative percentage change from this rate.
/// * Volume -- default 100
/// * Voice -- set a voice to use (not implemented)
/// * Gender -- set pick any voice of the given gender (not implemented)
/// * Bookmark -- set to `true` if a `mark`/`bookmark` should be part of the returned speech (used for sync highlighting)
///
/// Important: both the preference name and value are case-sensitive
/// 
/// This function can be called multiple times to set different values.
/// The values are persistent and extend beyond calls to [`set_mathml`].
/// A value can be overwritten by calling this function again with a different value.
/// 
/// FIX: Some preferences are both API and user preferences and something such as '!name' should be used for overrides. Not implemented yet.
pub fn set_preference(name: String, value: String) -> Result<()>

/// Given a key code along with the modifier keys, the current node is moved accordingly (or value reported in some cases).
/// `key` is the [keycode](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/KeyboardEvent/keyCode#constants_for_keycode_value) for the key (in JavaScript, `ev.key_code`)
/// The spoken text for the new current node is returned.
pub fn do_navigate_keypress(key: usize, shift_key: bool, control_key: bool, alt_key: bool, meta_key: bool) -> Result<String>

/// Given a navigation command, the current node is moved accordingly.
/// This is a higher level interface than `do_navigate_keypress` for applications that want to interpret the keys themselves.
/// The valid commands are:
/// * Standard move commands:
/// `MovePrevious`, `MoveNext`, `MoveStart`, `MoveEnd`, `MoveLineStart`, `MoveLineEnd`
/// * Movement in a table or elementary math:
/// `MoveCellPrevious`, `MoveCellNext`, `MoveCellUp`, `MoveCellDown`, `MoveColumnStart`, `MoveColumnEnd`
/// * Moving into children or out to parents:
/// `ZoomIn`, `ZoomOut`, `ZoomOutAll`, `ZoomInAll`
/// * Undo the last movement command:
/// `MoveLastLocation`
/// * Read commands (standard speech):
/// `ReadPrevious`, `ReadNext`, `ReadCurrent`, `ReadCellCurrent`, `ReadStart`, `ReadEnd`, `ReadLineStart`, `ReadLineEnd`
/// * Describe commands (overview):
/// `DescribePrevious`, `DescribeNext`, `DescribeCurrent`
/// * Location information:
/// `WhereAmI`, `WhereAmIAll`
/// * Change navigation modes (circle up/down):
///  `ToggleZoomLockUp`, `ToggleZoomLockDown`
/// * Speak the current navigation mode
/// `ToggleSpeakMode`
/// 
/// There are 10 place markers that can be set/read/described or moved to.
/// * Setting:
/// `SetPlacemarker0`, `SetPlacemarker1`, `SetPlacemarker2`, `SetPlacemarker3`, `SetPlacemarker4`, `SetPlacemarker5`, `SetPlacemarker6`, `SetPlacemarker7`, `SetPlacemarker8`, `SetPlacemarker9`
/// * Reading:
/// `Read0`, `Read1`, `Read2`, `Read3`, `Read4`, `Read5`, `Read6`, `Read7`, `Read8`, `Read9`
/// * Describing:
/// `Describe0`, `Describe1`, `Describe2`, `Describe3`, `Describe4`, `Describe5`, `Describe6`, `Describe7`, `Describe8`, `Describe9`
/// * Moving:
/// `MoveTo0`, `MoveTo1`, `MoveTo2`, `MoveTo3`, `MoveTo4`, `MoveTo5`, `MoveTo6`, `MoveTo7`, `MoveTo8`, `MoveTo9`
/// 
/// When done with Navigation, call with `Exit`
pub fn do_navigate_command(command: String) -> Result<String>

/// Return the MathML associated with the current (navigation) node.
/// The returned result is the `id` of the node and the offset (0-based) from that node (not yet implemented)
/// The offset is needed for token elements that have multiple characters.
pub fn get_navigation_mathml() -> Result<(String, usize)> 

/// Return the `id` and `offset` (0-based) associated with the current (navigation) node.
/// `offset` (not yet implemented)
/// The offset is needed for token elements that have multiple characters.
pub fn get_navigation_mathml_id() -> Result<(String, usize)>


/// Convert the returned error from set_mathml, etc., to a useful string for display
pub fn errors_to_string(e:&Error) -> String 

```

## Python Users
You can build your own Python interface, or use the one that is built with the related project [MathCATForPython](https://github.com/NSoiffer/MathCATForPython). This uses the Rust package pyo3.

The Python interface is basically the same as the Rust interface. When calling a function, it should be wrapped in
```
try:
    ...
except Exception as e:
    ...  # log the error 'e'
```


## Web Users
I built a web assembly version. Has a few compromises and requires some hand tweaks during the build process. Those need to be automated. It can be found at [MathCatDemo](https://github.com/NSoiffer/MathCATDemo). This builds a web page for demo purposes, so it is not a pure build for the Web. Nonetheless, it does demonstrate how that can be done.

## C/C++ Users
It should be easy to add a C/C++ interface, but I haven't done this yet. Please contact me if you are interested in using MathCAT from a C/C++ application.
