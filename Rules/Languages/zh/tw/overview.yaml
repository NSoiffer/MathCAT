# Provide an overview/outline/description of the math
# MathPlayer just tried to shorten things like "mfrac" by just saying "fraction"
#   For mrow, it say up to 5 operands and just say "and n more things" for the rest
# This results in strings of varying length. Given human memory is about 7 words long,
#   it would be better to aim for 7 words (maybe aim for a range of 6-10 words).
# Idea:
#   Start by generating a terse form of the speech
#   At every step when the strings are being joined
#     a) if the #words <= 7, return the joined string
#     b) otherwise, set verbosity to 'overview' and regenerate the expression and use that
# There is a balance that you want to maximize the info given, so 10 words is likely better then 3.
#   That might mean that at the top level, we may want to allow the first few children to expand
