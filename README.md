# MathCAT: Math Capable Assistive Technology
<img src="logo.png" style="position: relative; top: 16px; z-index: -1;">
is a library that supports conversion of MathML to:

* Speech strings with embedded speech engine commands
* Braille (Nemeth, UEB Technical, and eventually other braille math codes)
* Navigation of math (in multiple ways including overviews)

There are three related projects that make use of MathCAT:
* [MathCATDemo](https://nsoiffer.github.io/MathCATDemo/) -- an online demonstration of some of what can be done with MathCAT
* [A python interface for MathCAT](https://github.com/NSoiffer/MathCATForPython) -- used by a [MathCAT NVDA add-on](https://addons.nvda-project.org/addons/MathCAT.en.html).
* [A C/C++ interface for MathCAT](https://github.com/NSoiffer/MathCATForC)
