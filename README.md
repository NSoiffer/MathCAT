# MathCAT: Math Capable Assistive Technology

<img src="logo.png" style="position: relative; top: 16px; z-index: -1;">
is a library that supports conversion of MathML to:


* Speech strings (in several languages) with embedded speech engine commands
* Braille (Nemeth, UEB Technical, CMU, and many others)
* Navigation of math (in multiple ways including overviews)


There are four related projects that make use of MathCAT:
- [MathCATDemo](https://nsoiffer.github.io/MathCATDemo/) -- an online demonstration of some of what can be done with MathCAT
- [A python interface for MathCAT](https://github.com/NSoiffer/MathCATForPython) -- used by a [MathCAT NVDA add-on](https://addons.nvda-project.org/addons/MathCAT.en.html).
- [A C/C++ interface for MathCAT](https://github.com/NSoiffer/MathCATForC)
- [A Java interface for MathCAT](https://github.com/mwhapples/MathCAT4J) (thanks to Michael Whapples for working on that)

MathCAT is used in many assistive technologies including NVDA and JAWS.
